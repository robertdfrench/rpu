## Easy
Those other processing units are hard. They have like, features,
and performance guarantees, all kinds of stuff. You don't need
all that. Your buddy Robert's processing unit is *easy peasy*.
It only has a few instructions, and none of them do anything
crazy:

* `put`: Puts a number into a register. Easy!
* `add`: Adds two numbers together. *Easy!*
* `cp`: Copies stuff from one register to another. **Easy!**
